# Overview
This repository consolidates my work from the Artificial Intelligence course at Futuregames (2025). The repos contents can be divided into two categories - *Lab Assignments*, including preparatory tasks and post-task reflections, and *AI Project*, a project where I explore concepts related to AI further and weave together my current knowledge into one scene.

For ease of navigation and project management during this course, I have decided to keep both of these categories within the same repo.
