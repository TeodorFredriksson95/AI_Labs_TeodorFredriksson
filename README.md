# Overview
The purpose of this repo is to consolidate my work on the lab assignments given to the students attending the course 'AI' at Futuregames 2025. In this repo you will find the relevant code and assets used for each assignment, as well as a *Q&A* section for each lab where I answer questions given to me by my teacher. The questions are relevant to each chapter.

## Research ##
In preparation for each lab assignment, a preparatory research assignment is handed out. I am currently keeping my preparations in a separate repo, but will probably merge the contents of that repo with this one.

The preparatory repo can currently be found here: https://github.com/TeodorFredriksson95/FG_AI_Course_Preparatory_Tasks
